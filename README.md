Library for dealing with GS1 identifiers

[GS1](https://www.gs1.org/) is a ubiquitious system for globally unique identifiers in
business, and is a superset of better-known standard identifiers such as UPC, EAN, ISBN,
and ISSN.

GS1 also provides standards for how identifiers should be represented as barcodes and as RFID
tags (the Electronic Product Code standard).

## About this library

This library currently only includes functionality for a limited subset of the GS1 standard,
mostly focused around EPCs. Additional functionality is welcome.

I'm also not especially familiar with Rust yet, so suggestions on how to structure this code
better are greatly appreciated.

## Reference

The GS1 standards are [freely available](https://www.gs1.org/standards) and code in this
library is cross-referenced to these wherever possible.
